# Wazuh-SOAR-implementation
In this project, we're setting up Wazuh with a minimum of one Agent for monitoring and security purposes. We're also incorporating a free SOAR (Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response) platform like Shuffle into the system. Our aim is to enable basic automation tasks, particularly focusing on data enrichment.
