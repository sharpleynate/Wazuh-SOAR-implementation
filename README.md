# Wazuh-SOAR-implementation
In this project, we're setting up Wazuh with a minimum of one Agent for monitoring and security purposes. We're also incorporating a free SOAR (Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response) platform like Shuffle into the system. Our aim is to enable basic automation tasks, particularly focusing on data enrichment.

# What is Wazuh
Wazuh is an open-source security monitoring platform that provides intrusion detection, log analysis, and vulnerability detection capabilities, helping organizations to detect and respond to security threats in real-time.

# What is TheHive
TheHive is a scalable and collaborative security incident response platform that allows security teams to efficiently manage and investigate security incidents, facilitating coordination, analysis, and remediation efforts across the organization.

# Here I made my graph to have a clear plan of what will be doing for this project.
